## 🎮 Overview

**Island Tycoon** is a console-based simulation game that tests your ability to develop a thriving island community.
Begin with a small workforce, gather resource materials, and think carefully about how to upgrade buildings to improve production.
As your settlement expands, you must consider the balance between _resource collection_, _worker recruitment_, and _building upgrades_.
Every worker has their role to fulfill. Every structure serves a purpose. Every zone in your settlement contributes to the growth of your empire.
